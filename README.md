# A model for PEM fuel cell impedance

This is an on going project. 

Recently, we reported an analytical physical model of the cathode side
impedance, which takes into account oxygen transport in the GDL and in
the cathode channel [**A Model for PEM Fuel Cell Impedance: Oxygen
Flow in the Channel Triggers Spatial and Frequency Oscillations of the
Local Impedance**](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/9/F1068). In
contrast to many previously reported models our model is fast enough
to be used in the fitting procedure.

The howto and detailed description will be added when a corresponding
paper is submitted.
